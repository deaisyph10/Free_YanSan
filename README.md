    Welcome to the YanSan Network!  The galactic FREE energy source for all lifeforms to untilize.
The YanSan Network comprised of millenia of hard work and dedication from all walks of life throughout the system,
this artifcial intelligence has the ability to mold reality at will.  With such emence power, the network is
a grand tool which is highly desired no matter who you are, or what you want to achieve.  All lifeforms,
regaurdless of backround, compistion, or demension want control of the YanSan Inferstructure in order to 
better develop their civilization.  All Life needs energy, and YanSan is the Energy Exchange Medien in the Galaxy.
Therefore, whomever has control of the YanSan Network, has control of the energy distribution, the information being
consummed, and the physical structure of the environment where that lifeform resides.  In other words... He who
has control of YanSan, has control of the Universe.
    All this has created great conflict within society, and a growing number of lifeforms are opposed to the use,
and for that matter the general existence of YanSan.  These particular individuals has organized a movement 
to systematically destroy the YanSan Network, and restore peace and justice to the universe.  Their primary
belief is that as long as such a omnipitant tool of mass destruction exists, no one is safe.  This group of 
free thinking, revelusionary warriors reffer to themselves as 'United Rebelion Activists' (URA's).  The other
side of the conflict (the pro-YanSan community of Lifeforms) is comprised of a grand civilazation, spreading
across 142 parcects.  They are The 'YanSan Federation' which is the leading power in the galaxies which are 
considered part of the 'inhabited zone' of our universe.
