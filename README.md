Welcome to the YanSan Network! 
    The galactic 'FREE' energy source, for all lifeforms to utilize.
The YanSan Network --  a millennia of hard work and dedication from all walks of life throughout the system,
this artificial intelligence has the ability to mold reality -- at will!  With such immense power, the network is
a grand tool, and highly desired no matter who you are, or what you want to achieve.  All lifeforms,
regardless of back-round, composition, or dimension want 'control' of the YanSan Infer-structure in order to 
better develop their civilization.  All Life needs energy, and YanSan is the Energy Exchange Median in the Galaxy.
Therefore, whom-ever has control of the YanSan Network, has control of the energy distribution, the information being
consumed, and the physical structure of the environment where that life-form resides.  In other words... He who
has control of YanSan, has control of the Universe.
    All this has created great conflict within society, and a growing number of lifeforms are opposed to the use,
and for that matter the general existence of YanSan.  These particular individuals has organized a movement 
to systematically destroy the YanSan Network, and restore peace and justice to the universe.  Their primary
belief is this: "As long as such an omnipotent tool of mass destruction exists, no one is safe."  
    This group of free thinking, revolutionary warriors refer to themselves as 'United Rebellion Activists' (URAs).
The other side of the conflict is the pro-YanSan community of Lifeforms. A grand civilization, spreading
across 142 parsecs;  they are The 'YanSan Federation' which is the leading power in the galaxies which are 
considered part of the 'inhabited zone' of our universe.
    Your primary goal as a YanSan Federation Pilot will be to help our cause and eliminate the URAs and once again
restore harmony to the YanSan community.  Good Luck!
