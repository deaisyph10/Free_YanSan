# Free_YanSan
Space_Fighter_Game
The game has not yet been finished and is my first real project on pygame, so it is a bit rough>>>>//:
The first version of FREE YanSan is very close to being compete and this latest commit has restructured the main loop drastically.
I have built a Main class for all the group updates, blits, drawings, and 'if' statements in order to clean the mess I had.
This has improved game speed a lot!
